DATADOG

Datadog Challenge

Using Datadog, implement an innovative end-to-end observability monitoring strategy for an LLM application (new or reused) of your choice, powered by Vertex AI or Gemini. Stream LLM and runtime telemetry to Datadog, define detection rules, and present a clear dashboard that surfaces application health and the observability/security signals you consider essential. When any detection rule is triggered, leverage Datadog to define an actional item (e.g., case, incident, alert, etc.) with context for an AI engineer to act on.

You have full access to Datadog, be creative in how you leverage the platform and the telemetry you emit.

Hard requirements

    Provide an in-Datadog view that clearly shows your application health (e.g. latency/errors/tokens/cost), SLOs, and actionable items from the detection rules you defined.

    Create an actionable record inside Datadog with clear contextual information to drive next steps. (Incident Management or Case Management)

    Applications must leverage Vertex AI or Gemini as the model host.

    Report your application telemetry data to Datadog (e.g., LLM observability signals, APM, logs, infrastructure metrics, RUM, etc.) using your preferred method (auto-instrumentation, SDKs, or API).

    Define at least 3 detection rules in Datadog to evaluate application signals and determine when the app requires attention (e.g., monitors/SLOs).

    Create an actionable record inside Datadog with clear contextual information to drive next steps (E.g. Signal Data, Runbook, context around the signal).

    Provide an in-Datadog view that clearly shows application health from the relevant signals collected, detection rules status and any actional items status derived from your detection rules.

What to Submit

    Hosted application URL

    Public repo with:

        Approved OSI license

        The instrumented LLM application

        JSON export with the Datadog configurations you made (monitors, SLOs, dashboards, etc.)

        Name the Datadog organization you configured.

        Traffic generator: A script that generates interactions with your application and demonstrates detection rules in action.

    3-minute video walkthrough of the solution:

        Explain your observability strategy, the thought process behind your detection rules, what sets you apart from an innovation perspective and any challenges you faced.

    Evidence of your strategy:

        Functioning dashboard link/screenshots

        Criteria and rationale behind the detection rules configured

        Incident example: Screenshots showing symptoms, what tripped, timeframe, actionable item creation from detection rule, etc.
