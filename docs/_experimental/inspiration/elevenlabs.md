ELEVENLABS

ElevenLabs Challenge

Use ElevenLabs and Google Cloud AI to make your app conversational, intelligent, and voice-driven.

Combine ElevenLabs Agents with Google Cloud Vertex AI or Gemini to give your app a natural, human voice and personality — enabling users to interact entirely through speech. You can integrate ElevenLabs’ APIs directly into your app using our React SDK or via server-side calls hosted on Google Cloud.
